flee script triggers but units do not move, get just deleted, but probably only if used on pre placed units.

other way around, surrender seems to not work on spawned units.... this shit is ultra weird.

fire functions have been fixed but not yet tested.


need to make the vars public to be broadcasted or some shit, can not access them anywhere but server... maybe because defined in init server....

woah, can humans get any more tired?! :(
